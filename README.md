# Landing_page_Udacity
### This is the repository for Project 1: Landing Page of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. The project helps to get hands on experience in the DOM manipulation using Javascript. I have created a navigation bar with links using DOM.


## Navigation

##### Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.

## Section Active State

##### It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.

## Scroll to Anchor

##### When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
